      <p>This page was part of my final project for the IGME 230 class where I used various things I've learned during this course to create a website about the most popular video game consoles of 2017.</p>
      <p>Alvaro Trigo's fullPage.js was used for the creation of this website. This was the most challenging part of the website as it wasn't something that we learned during class so I had to do a lot of trial and error testing and looking at other websites that also used this plugin as an example to learn how to integrate it into my project using my own content.</p>
      <p>Another tool that I used for this site was Erik Terwan's hamburger menu from codepen.io which helped me integrate a simple and easy to use navigation menu to my page. Most of my modifications to this part of the code involved changing the content to fit my own page's information and the placement of the button on the page.</p>
      <p>Some of the main inspirations that gave me the idea for the structure of this page came from example designs such as https://onepagelove.com/alyoop-of-the-week where I took ideas such as using a full colored page and centered image and integrated them into my page to fit my own content instead.</p>
