## Angus Tang Project 4 Description

### Project Summary
I will be creating a website about video game consoles with a total of four pages. One main directory page and the other three
for each of the current most popular consoles (Xbox, PS4, Nintendo Switch). The directory page will be used as the main page
that users first see when the visit the page and will include a brief description about video game consoles in general. The
subpages will focus on the specific consoles and descriptions about each of them such as their functionalities and games. 

### Learning & Resources
I will be using various javascript resources and websites for the implementation of this project.
  - https://css-tricks.com/controlling-css-animations-transitions-javascript/
    Learning how to create zooming in effect of images when hovered on so users can get more detailed looks at the images 
    of the consoles etc.
    
  - https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/silky-smooth-web-animation-with-velocityjs--cms-24266
    Scroll up and down buttons at the very top and bottom of the pages with text. 
    
  - http://api.jquery.com/category/effects/
    Fading in of text (and maybe images) when user scrolls down.
    
  - More to be added later, need to plan and see how the current ones work together before deciding what more to add in the future steps.
